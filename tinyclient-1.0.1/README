COPYRIGHT

 This program is placed in the public domain. 

 You may use it as a starting point for writing your own MUD client.

CREDIT

 I would appreciated being credited in the event that you use this code.

NO WARRANTY

 Because the program is in the public domain, there is no warranty for the program,
 to the extent permitted by applicable law.

 The author provides the program "as is" without warranty of any kind, either
 expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of
 merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

 The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you.

 Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing,
 repair or correction.

INSTALLATION

 The simplest way to compile the program is to type "make". This should use the
 enclosed "Makefile" to compile and link. If this doesn't work, to compile without
 using the makefile:

   gcc tinyclient.c -o tinyclient -g -Wall

EXECUTION

 Run the client like this:

  ./tinyclient

TESTING

 The default behaviour is to connect to localhost on port 4000 (change defines in 
 the code to alter this).
